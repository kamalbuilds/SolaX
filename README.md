Solax is an intuitive Dapp that aims to give its users the best experience by simplifing the experience of buying and selling items using different tokens on multiple chains. With a focus on privacy and cross-chain compatibility, Solax is powered by the Elusiv protocol for ensuring transactional privacy and the Wormhole protocol for facilitating cross-chain transactions.

## Technologies used ‚öôÔ∏è 

### Wormhole Protocol

A crucial element that powers Solax, Wormhole Protocol offers an indispensable cross-chain capability. It allows users and merchants to bridge their tokens from any blockchain, essentially making Solax a blockchain-agnostic platform. A typical use case could involve an NFT owner wishing to transfer their asset from Solana to Ethereum; Wormhole makes this possible. By enabling token burning and bridging across various chains, Wormhole ensures that Solax remains truly decentralized and flexible.

### Elusiv Protocol

Privacy is a fundamental right, not an option, and that's what we emphasize with the integration of the Elusiv Protocol. It enables users to top-up and make payments privately through their wallets. Users can also exchange zero-knowledge (zk) messages with each other or with merchants, all of which can be conveniently tracked in the Activity tab. By combining zk-SNARKs and the Elusiv protocol, we ensure privacy-preserving transactions, thereby building trust and protecting the identity of our users.

### Pyth Solana Price Feeds

At Solax, we want to ensure users are well informed about the price of tokens. Pyth price feeds provide live SOL/USD price feeds on NFTs, aiding users in their purchase decisions. Users also get access to a comprehensive trading graph, which is highly useful as it offers comparison features, live prices, past rates, etc., for any token a user needs. The integration of Pyth price feeds not only aids in decision-making but also drives the cross-chain functionality of Solax.

### Durable Nonces: Sign now and pay later when the product is available or Purchase on your own timings based on Conditions.

Durable Nonces: Durable nonces are a remarkable feature of the Solana ecosystem that we utilized extensively in SOLAX. They permit users to "sign now, pay later," a mechanism that's especially handy for products or services not available instantly. With durable nonces, our users can pre-authorize payments, benefiting both buyers and sellers by locking in the agreement. This feature also optimizes gas fees by allowing users to sign transactions during periods of high fees and then submit them when the fees decrease. Additionally, durable nonces support batched transactions and time-dependent transactions, allowing multiple transactions to be processed at once or transactions to be automatically submitted when certain conditions are met.

In this way, by integrating durable nonces into our Dapp, we not only optimized the transaction processes but also gave our users a higher level of flexibility and control over their transactions.

- Pre-Authorized Payments: Users can pre-authorize the payment for a product that isn't yet available or for a service to be rendered in the future. By using a durable nonce, the buyer can sign the transaction at the time of agreement the seller can submit it when the product or service is ready.

- Optimized Gas Fees: In a congested network, transaction fees (gas fees) can fluctuate rapidly. Durable nonces allow users to sign transactions during periods of high fees and then submit them when the fees decrease.

- Batched Transactions: Sometimes, it might be more efficient to batch multiple transactions and process them all at once. Durable nonces can be used to create these transactions ahead of time and then submit them together when ready.

- Time-Dependent Transactions: If you have transactions that are dependent on a specific time or condition, durable nonces used are extremely useful. Users can sign transactions in advance and then have them automatically submitted when the specified conditions are met.

### Solanapay powered QR Code Payments

QR Code Payments are an effortless and straightforward way to facilitate transactions. We've integrated Solanapay to enable QR Code payments within Solax, making the payment process smoother and faster. This mechanism ensures that the payment process is secure and the transactions are validated, providing a seamless experience to our customers.

The Transfer request follows  this mechanism

* Customer goes to the payment page
* Merchant frontend (client) sends order information to the backend
* Merchant backend (server) generates a reference public key and stores it in a database with the expected amount for the shopping cart / pending purchase (unique to each customer's checkout session).
* Merchant backend redirects the user to the confirmation page with the generated reference public key.
* The confirmation page redirects to the merchant with the transaction signature.
* Merchant backend checks that the transaction is valid for the checkout session by validating the transaction with the reference and amount stored in step 3.
  
## üîß Setup

1. Install the dependencies:
