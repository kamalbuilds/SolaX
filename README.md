**Durable Nounces**: Sign now and pay later when the product is available or Purchase on your own timings.

- Pre-Authorized Payments: Users could pre-authorize the payment for a product that isn't yet available or for a service to be rendered in the future. By using a durable nonce, the buyer can sign the transaction at the time of agreement and the seller can submit it when the product or service is ready.

- Optimized Gas Fees: In a congested network, transaction fees (gas fees) can fluctuate rapidly. Durable nonces can allow users to sign transactions during periods of high fees and then submit them when the fees decrease.

- Batched Transactions: Sometimes, it might be more efficient to batch multiple transactions and process them all at once. Durable nonces can be used to create these transactions ahead of time and then submit them together when ready.

- Time-Dependent Transactions: If you have transactions that are dependent on a specific time or condition, durable nonces can be extremely useful. Users can sign transactions in advance and then have them automatically submitted when the specified conditions are met.

* Customer goes to the payment page
* Merchant frontend (client) sends order information to the backend
* Merchant backend (server) generates a reference public key and stores it in a database with the expected amount for the shopping cart / pending purchase (unique to each customer's checkout session).
* Merchant backend redirects the user to the confirmation page with the generated reference public key.
* The confirmation page redirects to the merchant with the transaction signature.
* Merchant backend checks that the transaction is valid for the checkout session by validating the transaction with the reference and amount stored in step 3.
